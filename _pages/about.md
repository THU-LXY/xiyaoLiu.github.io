  My name is **Xiyao Liu（刘西尧）**, a Third year student from [WeiXian College](https://www.wxc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. I am major in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrument. My research interests include *frequency comb spectroscopy, cavity enhanced spectroscopy and there applications in real-life scenario(open path measurement, trace gas sensing etc.*, Also some AI method combining with OFC spectroscopy.

  I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Haoyun](https://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/team/luckiwei), whose research interests include dual comb spectroscopy, Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy.

## Projects
### <span style="color:#3E608D"><b>Non-Cooperative Target Dual-Comb Gas Spectroscopy Analysis Via Deep Learning</b></span>  
*Innovative Training Program for University Students*  
**June 2024 – April 2025**  
- Developed a deep learning framework to reconstruct high-SNR spectra from noisy dual-comb signals under non-cooperative reflection conditions.  
- Integrated spectral denoising, baseline correction, and gas concentration regression into an end-to-end model.  
- Improved robustness of gas detection in low-reflectivity and weak-signal environments.

### <span style="color:#3E608D"><b>Real-Time Dual-Comb IGM Correction Based on FPGA</b></span>  
*Tsinghua University Academic Research Promotion Program (Grade A)*  
**July 2025 – Present**  
- Designing FPGA-based hardware to enable real-time correction of dual-comb interferograms (IGM).  
- Achieved preliminary acceleration of data throughput for spectral acquisition and processing.  
- Lays the foundation for portable and high-speed dual-comb spectroscopic analysis.
