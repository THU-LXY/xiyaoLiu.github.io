My research interests include frequency comb spectroscopy, cavity enhanced spectroscopy and there applications in Trace gas sensing, Also some AI method combining with OFC spectroscopy.

  I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Haoyun](https://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/team/luckiwei), whose research interests include dual comb spectroscopy, Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy.
